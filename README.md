## Project Overview
This portfolio website is a single-page application designed to present my skills, completed projects, and professional experience. The goal of this portfolio is to serve as an interactive, visually appealing resume for potential employers, clients, and collaborators.

The website is fully responsive, meaning it is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic, easy-to-navigate interface.

## Features
1. Responsive Design: Works on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
2. Smooth Navigation: Links to different sections of the site for easy access to content.
3. Interactive Animations: Buttons, hover effects, and an animated logo add a modern, professional touch.
3. Project Showcase: Displays key projects like a water conservation chatbot and crop yield prediction solution, with descriptions and links.
4. Social Media Integration: Links to my profiles on Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
5. Resume Download: Allows users to download my resume in PDF format.
6. Contact Information: Includes my email and phone number for quick communication.

The following technologies and tools were used to create this project:

1. HTML5: For the structure of the website.
