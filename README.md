This portfolio website is a single-page application designed to present my skills, completed projects, and professional experience. The goal of this portfolio is to serve as an interactive, visually appealing resume for potential employers, clients, and collaborators.

The website is fully responsive, meaning it is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic, easy-to-navigate interface.
